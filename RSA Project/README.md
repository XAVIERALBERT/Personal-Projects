RSA Project by Xavier Angeles-Cruz

Started on 7/27/2025
Created main file and plan out rest of RSA project. Will start with capital 26 letter English characters and no spaces. Have to solve cases that start with 'A'. For some reason certain words and lengths break the conversion (The number is too big to calculate).

Finally fixed the header issues. Added RSA header file and associated .cpp files. implemented the RSA encrpy/decrypt functions. May have to implement several functions in MainFile as well as some variables in MainFile. Looking to have a console buffer soon for operator to change values and etc. 

7/30/2025
Implemented Euler Phi function. Just defined inverseMod and ExtndEuc (Extended Euclidean) functions and haven't implemented yet. May have temporary solution to fix the 'A' problem in the conversion and reconverison functions.

7/31/2025
Implemented and tested extended euclidean gcd algorithm and inverse mod functions.
